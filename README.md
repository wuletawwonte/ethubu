> This is a custom shell script designed to automate the setup process following a fresh Ubuntu Desktop installation. It installs the software I regularly use mostly for development and applies my preferred system settings.

## Features

- Third Party Repositories: Adds PPAs and installs both terminal and desktop applications that are not included in the official Ubuntu respository. 
- Desktop Environment Tweaks: Personalizes the desktop environment with my preffered settings. 

## How to Use

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wuletawwonte/my-ubuntu-setup
   cd my-ubuntu-setup
   ```

2. Make the `setup.sh` file Executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

4. Follow the Prompts: The script may prompt you for input during the setup process to ensure everything is configured according to your preferences. 

## Customization
